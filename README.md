# aerospike-rest-python-scripts

Some python CRUD scripts for interacting with a running aerospike database.

_Note: Meant to be for testing locally- NOT as a high performance backend!_

## Running Scripts

Run python v3 with the filename as an argument.

For example:
```python
python3 create_record.py
```
